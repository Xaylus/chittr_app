# chittr_app
This app works like twitter, the users can post things that are called 'Chits' that are a maximum of 144 characters.

## Getting Started

First you need to navigate to the command prompt and the folder location of the project.
Then you need to run 
```
npm install
```
This should run and install all dependancies. (Might take a little while)
NOTE: Run it twice as sometimes it does not install dependancies correctly the first time.

Next open android studio and go to file,open and navigate to
```
chittr_app/android/
```
and open project.

Wait for the build.Gradle to finish and then go to the command line and run
```
npx react-native run-android
```
Enjoy!
